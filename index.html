        <p>To remap a key: click on it on the list, and a small window should pop up, asking what you want the new key to be. Simply enter the key and click "OK". If you can't type the key you want: type its name instead. "Backspace" for backspace, "enter" for enter, "left" for left arrow, "page up" for page up, etc. To reset every key to default: click on the "Controls" title.</p>
        <p>To interact with an object: you must be standing less than one block, but more than zero pixels, away, you must be facing the object, and you must hit the appropriate key. The direction you are facing is indicated by your arms, which will always point forward. You can change this direction by moving in the direction you wish to face.</p>

        <h2>About The Forest</h2>
        <p>You're lost in the forest, with only a camp-fire to keep you warm. All you have to eat is berries, and your only source of water is a small pond. How long can you survive before thirst, hunger, or the weather kills you?</p>
        <p>Your vitals are on the bottom-left. In order, from top to bottom, they are: Warmth, Food, and Water. They will decrease as time goes on, but Food will decrease faster than Warmth, and Water faster than Food.</p>
        <p>You can increase your Warmth meter by standing near the camp-fire while it's lit. You'll have to feed it wood in order to keep the fire going, which can be harvested from the nearby trees.</p>
        <p>You can increase your Food meter by eating berries, which can be picked from bushes. When the bushes turn yellow: you'll need to water them, or they'll stop producing fruit, and eventually die forever! You can plant new bushes below you by sacrificing a single berry.</p>
        <p>You can increase your Water meter by drinking from the pond, or by consuming the water you're carrying. It's recommended to always pick up water before you leave the pond!</p>
        <p>On the top-right is your inventory. This will tell you how many berries you have, how much wood you've harvested, and whether or not you're holding water. You can only have 99 berries, 25 wood, and 1 water.</p>
